        <h1>Chewie, we're home.</h1>
            <p1>Some facts about Mars: It has 24.5 hour days, 144 trillion square meters of land area (roughly equivalent to the land area of Earth), and an average temperature of -85F. That's cold, but better than any of our other options. First, a self sustaining martian colony is a Plan B for Earth, should a catastrophe occur that wipes out humanity.</p1>

    <div class="kolonne2a3">
        <h1> Do. Or do not. There is no try. </h1>
            <p1>Second, rare and valuable metals are abundant on Mars, and Deuterium is 5x more abundant, the fuel of choice should we ever achieve nuclear fusion as a power source. There is commercial and economic motivations to mine and manufacture on Mars. Because gravity is 2.4x less than on Earth, escape velocity is thusly lower and exporting of world to Earth is cheaper than going from Earth to Mars.</p1>

    <div class="kolonne3a3">
        <h1>I am no Jedi</h1>
            <p1>Third, there is substantial opportunity for scientific research on Mars, looking for martian life and furthering our understanding of the creation of our solar system. There is also materials science and pharmaceutical chemistry that is achievable on Mars due to the lower gravity than here on Earth. For example, did you know you can make aluminum more transparent than your typical silicon glass? The problem is gravitational shear as the metal cools. There are methods to get around this but it's extremely expensive, reserved for high end optics and bulletproof US fighter jet cockpit domes because it's a government contract so fuck it. But in space or on Mars, if the gravity is low enough, they can mass produce aluminum glass; never again will you shatter your phone screen by dropping it. Or shooting it, apparently.</p1>
