    <h2>BioSentinel</h2><br>
    <p1>The BioSentinel mission was selected as one of the secondary payloads, and the sole biological experiment, to fly on NASA’s Artemis I mission planned to launch in 2021. The primary objective of BioSentinel is to develop a biosensor to detect and measure the impact of space radiation on living organisms over long durations beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO). While progress identifying and characterizing biological radiation effects using Earth-based facilities has been significant, no terrestrial source can fully simulate the unique radiation environment encountered in deep space.<br><br>
    The BioSentinel biosensor utilizes the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to query the biological response to ambient deep space radiation, including the formation of double strand breaks (DSBs). DSBs are deleterious DNA lesions that are generated by exposure to highly energetic particles in the deep space radiation spectrum, and that are often repaired without errors by the cell. The biosensor contains two genetically engineered yeast strains: a wild type strain that serves as a control for yeast health and “normal” DNA damage repair, and a rad51 deletion strain, which is defective for DNA damage repair, and will therefore undergo alterations to growth and metabolism as it accumulates radiation damage. These changes will be detected by the biosensor payload.</p1>

    <h2>CubeSat Laser Infrared CrosslinK </h2><br>
<p1>The CubeSat Laser Infrared CrosslinK (CLICK) mission will demonstrate technology to advance the state of the art in communications between small spacecraft as well as the capability to gauge their relative distance and location. CLICK is comprised of two sequential missions.<br><br>

The first mission, CLICK A, is a risk reduction mission that will test out elements of the optical (laser) communications with a single 3-unit (3U) spacecraft. The key objective of this risk reduction testing is to demonstrate the fine steering mirror control system’s high precision pointing performance which enables the use of a lower power laser in CLICK B/C. This will be demonstrated via communication between the spacecraft in low-Earth orbit and a portable ground station telescope. The key performance metric of CLICK A is to establish a greater than 10 megabits per second (Mbps) data downlink from the CLICK A spacecraft from an altitude of approximately 249 miles (400 kilometers), to a 12-inch (30-centimeter) telescope on the ground.</p1>

<h2>SPHERES</h2><br>
SPHERES consists of three free flying vehicles inside the International Space Station (ISS) identifiable by their shell colors of Red, Blue, and Orange.  Initially the SPHERES were designed for testing on control theory algorithms.  The Satellites are about the size and mass of a bowling ball and use cold gas thrusters (CO2) to propel the vehicles around a fixed experiemntal volume.  The SPHERES program currently operates out of the Japanese Experimental Module (JEM) inside the ISS.
