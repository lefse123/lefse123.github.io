<h1>Human Space Lift</h1>

<div class ="container-hsl">
<p1>Every day since Nov. 2, 2000, people have been orbiting our planet inside the International Space Station, bringing together science, technology and human innovation to enable new technologies and research breakthroughs not possible on Earth. <br><br>

NASA astronauts and scientific work spaces aboard the station, as well as scientific investigations installed outside the station, make possible fundamental and cross-discipline research, advancing scientific knowledge about Earth, space and the physical and biological sciences, benefitting people living on our home planet and future explorers. As a testbed for deep space exploration, the station is helping us learn how to keep astronauts healthy during long-duration space travel and demonstrating technologies for human and robotic exploration beyond low-Earth orbit, to the Moon and Mars.<br><br>

The station facilitates the growth of a robust commercial market in low-Earth orbit as the only U.S. National Laboratory in space. Commercial cargo resupply and commercial crew transportation to the station and low-Earth orbit will enable a space exploration economy. The International Space Station is a blueprint for global cooperation for future exploration beyond Earth – one that enables U.S.-led multinational partnerships and advances shared goals in space exploration.<br><br>

NASA’s Commercial Crew Program is working with American aerospace industry as Boeing and SpaceX develop and operate a new generation of spacecraft and launch systems to carry crews of four to the International Space Station, which will provide additional research time and broader opportunities of discovery on the orbiting laboratory.<br><br>

With commercial companies providing astronaut transportation to and from low-Earth orbit, NASA can focus on building spacecraft and rockets for missions to the Moon and Mars.<br><br>

As the third-brightest object in the sky (only the Sun and Moon are brighter!), the International Space Station is easy to see at dawn or dusk when it flies over your home. Sign up for text messages or emails to know when and where to look up and wave at the astronauts at <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/topics/humans-in-space/overview">NASA’s</a> Spot the Station website.</p1>
