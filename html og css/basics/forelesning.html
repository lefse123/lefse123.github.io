    <h1> Salary</h1>
    <h2> Coders salary</h2>
    <p> Sometimes the difference in pay comes down to skills (and the demand for them). 
        <a  href = "https://www.itobwatch.co.uk/IT-Job-Market/UK/Programming-Languages"> For example coding languages. </a></p>

    <h3> Salaries are not just about the main skills </h3>
    <p> Usually, secondary skills are wanted as well. And experience counts a lot. </p>
    <p> Therefore, please mind that "median salary" is not first-job pay. So with a lot of experienced Java-programmers out there, the median salary may be much higher than starting salary. </p>
